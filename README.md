Recently, supervised learning based image restoration (IR) methods have shown promising performance. However, their reliance on external paired datasets limits their applicability and may lead to performance drops when handling imaging domains not included in the training data. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised approach to IR. Our goal is to develop an effective and robust model capable of characterizing complex real image degradation mechanisms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a dual-scale prior (DSP) model designed to capture the intricacies of image degradation. DSP consists of two components: group-scale and image-scale priors. The group-scale component leverages internal sparsity and low-rank priors within groups of similar patches to explore strong correlations among them. Meanwhile, the image-scale component utilizes a pre-trained deep denoising prior to capture external characteristics. These dual-scale priors work in tandem to preserve edges and remove noise, achieving high-quality restoration performance. We then present DSPIR, a powerful IR framework by incorporating our DSP model into maximum a posteriori (MAP) principle. DSPIR inherits the advantages of flexibility and generalization of model-based methods, and absorbs the superior representation capability of learning-based methods. Our model- and learning-based optimization framework is decomposed into several sub-problems by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results on image denoising and inpainting demonstrate the effectiveness of DSPIR.
